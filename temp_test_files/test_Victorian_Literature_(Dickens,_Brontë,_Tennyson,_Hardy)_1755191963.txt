RISPOSTA UTENTE: Both Victorian authors dealt with social injustices typical of the Victorian Age. The Victorian age, although saw on the one hand the advancement of techonology and scientific discovery, on the other saw poor living conditions of the working class, examples of what is defined the Victorian Compromise. Charles Dickens in hard times specifically describes the exploitment of child labour, ill treatment in the industrialized world, as a critique to the Victorian society of the time. Charles dickens is consider master in characterization, where his characters are described in detailed in a realistic way and follow a growth journey. Moreover he made a sharp distinction between the good and the bad. Thomas Hardy in Tess of the d'Ubervilles makes a critique on the Victorian society's hypocrisy for what concerns morality and a rigid way of conduct. The heroine in question, according to the the victorian society is a fallen woman, while hardy considers her a good and innocent woman, victim of the circumstances and faith. underlying his pessimistic view. both authors master in language use, changing registers and also using dialects.


VALUTAZIONE: **SCORE: 68/100**  

**COMMENT:**  

**Strengths:**  
- The student identifies key themes of social injustice in both novels (*Hard Times* and *Tess of the d’Urbervilles*) and links them to broader Victorian societal issues, such as industrialization and moral hypocrisy.  
- Basic textual evidence is provided (e.g., child labor in Dickens, Tess as a "fallen woman" in Hardy).  
- The response acknowledges the authors' narrative techniques (characterization, language use) and their critiques of society.  

**Areas for Improvement:**  
- **Content (25/40):** The analysis lacks depth and detailed textual support. For example, specific scenes or quotes from the novels would strengthen the argument. The comparison/contrast is underdeveloped—more focus on how each author’s *narrative style* (e.g., Dickens’ satire vs. Hardy’s tragedy) or *symbolism* (e.g., Coketown’s mechanization vs. Tess’s natural imagery) differs would elevate the response.  
- **Language (20/30):** There are grammatical errors ("techonology," "exploitment," "hardy considers her a good and innocent woman, victim of the circumstances and faith. underlying his pessimistic view"). Vocabulary is adequate but repetitive (e.g., "critique" used multiple times without variation).  
- **Structure (23/30):** The response is somewhat disorganized, with abrupt shifts between ideas. A clearer structure (e.g., separate paragraphs for Dickens/Hardy, thematic comparisons, and narrative techniques) would improve coherence.  

**Suggestions:**  
- Add specific examples (e.g., Gradgrind’s utilitarianism in *Hard Times*, the symbolism of Stonehenge in *Tess*).  
- Proofread for grammar and fluency.  
- Use transitional phrases to connect ideas (e.g., "In contrast," "Similarly").  
- Expand on how each author’s *style* shapes their critique (e.g., Dickens’ exaggerated characters vs. Hardy’s tragic realism).  

Overall, the response demonstrates a foundational understanding but needs sharper analysis and refinement.
